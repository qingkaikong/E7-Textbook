    "We will introduce you to Python by demonstrating features found in any standard graphing calculator. An **arithmetic operation** is either addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or powers between two numbers. An **arithmetic operator** is a symbol that Python has reserved to mean one of the aforementioned operations. These symbols are + for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication, / for division, and ** for exponentiation. \n",
