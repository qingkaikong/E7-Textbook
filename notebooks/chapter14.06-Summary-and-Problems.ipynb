    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linear algebra is the foundation of many engineering fields.\n",
    "2. Vectors can be considered as points in ${\\mathbb{R}}^n$; addition and multiplication are defined on them, although not necessarily the same as for scalars.\n",
    "3. A set of vectors is linearly independent if none of the vectors can be written as a linear combination of the others.\n",
    "4. Matrices are tables of numbers. They have several important properties including the determinant, rank, and inverse.\n",
    "5. A system of linear equations can be represented by the matrix equation $Ax = y$.\n",
    "6. The number of solutions to a system of linear equations is related to the rank($A$) and the rank($[A,y]$). It can be zero, one, or infinity.\n",
    "7. We can solve the equations using matrix inversion, Gauss Elimination, Gauss-Jordan Elimination, and LU decomposition. "
