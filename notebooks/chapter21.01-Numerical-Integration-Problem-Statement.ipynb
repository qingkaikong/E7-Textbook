    "Given a function $f(x)$, we want to approximate the integral of $f(x)$ over the total **interval**, $[a,b]$. The following figure illustrates this area. To accomplish this goal, we assume that the interval has been discretized into a numeral grid, $x$, consisting of $n+1$ points with spacing, $h = \\frac{b - a}{n}$. Here, we denote each point in $x$ by $x_i$, where $x_0 = a$ and $x_n = b$. Note: There are $n+1$ grid points because the count starts at $x_0$. We also assume we have a function, $f(x)$, that can be computed for any of the grid points, or that we have been given the function implicitly as $f(x_i)$. The interval $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$ is referred to as a **subinterval**.\n",

    "The following sections give some of the most common methods of approximating $\\int_a^b f(x) dx$. Each method approximates the area under $f(x)$ for each subinterval by a shape for which it is easy to compute the exact area, and then sums the area contributions of every subinterval."
