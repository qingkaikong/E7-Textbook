    "The easiest way to run Python code is through the Python shell or Ipython Shell (which stands for Interactive Python). The Ipython shell is richer than Python shell, such as Tab autocompletion, color-highlighted error messages, basic UNIX shell integration and so on. Since we just installed Ipython, let's try to run the hello world example. The way we launch either Python or Ipython shell is by typing it in a terminal. Then we could run Python command by typing it into the shell, by pressing enter, we immediately see the results from the command. For example, we could print out Hello World by typing `print(\"Hello World\")`:\n",

    "![Hello_world](images/01.01.6-ipython_example.png \"Run Hello World in Ipython shell\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above command, the *print()* is a function in Python, and \"Hello World\" is a string data type that we will introduce them later in the book. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Run Python script/file from command line**\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2nd way to run Python code is to put all the commands into a file and save it as 'name.py' file (the extension of the file could be anything, but by convention, it is usually py). For example, use your favorite text editor (I am using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) here), put the command in a file called 'hello_world.py':\n",
