    "In practice, some ODEs have bad behavior known as **stiffness**. Loosely speaking, stiffness refers to systems that can have very sharp changes in derivative. An example of a stiff system is a bouncing ball, which\n",
    "suddenly changes directions when it hits the ground. Depending on the properties of the ODE you are solving and the desired level of accuracy, you might need to use different methods for *solve\\_ivp*. There are many methods that you can choose for the *method* argument in *solve\\_ivp*, take a look of the [documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html#scipy.integrate.solve_ivp) to understand it more. As suggested by the documentation, you should use the 'RK45' or 'RK23' method for non-stiff problems and 'Radau' or 'BDF' for stiff problems. If not sure, first try to run 'RK45'. If needs unusually many iterations, diverges, or fails, your problem is likely to be stiff and you should use 'Radau' or 'BDF'. 'LSODA' can also be a good universal choice, but it might be somewhat less convenient to work with as it wraps old Fortran code."
