    "A **logical expression** is a statement that can either be true or false. For example, $a < b$ is a logical expression. It can be true or false depending on what values of $a$ and $b$ are given. Note that this differs from a **mathematical expression** which denotes a truth statement. In the previous example, the mathematical expression $a < b$ means that $a$ is less than $b$, and values of $a$ and $b$ where $a \\ge b$ are not permitted. Logical expressions form the basis of computing, so for the purposes of this book, all statements are assumed to be logical rather than mathematical unless otherwise indicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a logical expression that is true will compute to the value \"True\". A false expression will compute to the value \"False\". For the purpose of this book, \"True\" is equivalent to 1, and \"False\" is equivalent to 0. Distinguishing between the numbers 1 and 0 and the logical values \"True\" and \"False\" is beyond the scope of this book, but it is covered in more advanced books on computing. Logical expressions are used to pose questions to Python. For example, \"$3 < 4$\" is equivalent to, \"Is 3 less than 4?\" Since this statement is true, Python will compute it as 1. However, $3 > 4$ is false, therefore Python will compute it as 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparison operators** compare the value of two numbers, and they are used to build logical expressions. Python reserves the symbols $>, >=, <, <=, !=, ==$, to denote \"greater than\", \"greater than or equal\", \"less than\", \"less than or equal\", \"not equal\", and \"equal\", respectively. Let's start with an example a = 4, b = 2, and see the following table:\n",
