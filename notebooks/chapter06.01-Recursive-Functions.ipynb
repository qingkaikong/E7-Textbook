    "__WHAT IS HAPPENING?__ First recall that when Python executes a function, it creates a workspace for the variables that are created in that function, and whenever a function calls another function, it will wait until that function returns an answer before continuing. For example, in the *np.sin(np.tan(x))*, *sin* must wait for *tan* to return an answer before it can be evaluated. Even though a recursive function makes calls to itself, the same rules apply.\n",

In general, iterative functions are faster than recursive functions that perform the same task. So why use recursive functions at all?
