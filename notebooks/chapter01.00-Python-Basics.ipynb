    "This chapter gets you started with Python, using it as a calculator, managing Python packages, getting familiar with the Jupyter Notebook. As you will see, Python has a great community with packages that could potentially do anything. At the end of this chapter, you should be familiar with Python, how to execute commmands in Python, and in Jupyter Notebook, how to install and manage the Python packages, and Python's basic mathematical functionalities.  \n",
