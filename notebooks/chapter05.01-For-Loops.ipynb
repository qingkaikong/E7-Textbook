    "Many tasks in life are boring or tedious because they require doing the same  basic actions over and over again—iterating—in slightly different contexts. For example, consider looking up the definition of 20 words in the dictionary, populating a large table of numbers with data, alphabetizing many stacks of paper, or dusting off every object and shelf in your room. Since repetitive tasks appear so frequently, it is only natural that programming languages like Python would have direct methods of performing iteration.\n",

    "A for-loop is a sequence of instructions that is repeated, or iterated, for every value of a looping array. The variable that holds the current value of the looping array is called the looping variable. Sometimes for-loops are referred to as definite loops because they have a predefined begin and end. The general syntax for a for-loop block is as follows."
