    "A **class** is a definition of the structure that we want. Similar to a function, it is defined as a block of code starting with the **class** statement. The syntax of defining a class is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ClassName(superclass):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __init__(self, arguments):\n",
    "        # define or assign object attributes\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def other_methods(self, arguments):\n",
    "        # body of the method\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see the definition of a class is very similar to a function. It also needs to be called first before you can use it. For the class name, it should normally use the CapWords convention. The **superclass** is used when you want create a new class to **inherit** the attributes and methods from another already defined class. We will talk more about **inheritance** in the next section. The **\\_\\_init__** is one of the special methods in Python classes that is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated (created). It is a method to assign initial values to the object before it is ready for you to use it. Note the two underscores at the beginning and end of the init, it indicates that the methods is called by Python instead of you. In this init method, you can assign attributes directly or pass in values to the attributes when you create the object. The other_methods functions are used to define the methods that will apply on the attributes, just like other functions. You may also notice that, there is an argument **self** for each method in the class, what's that? This is the difference of a class method function versus a regular function, that a class method must have an extra argument as the first argument when you define it. This particular argument refers to the object itself, and we usually use **self** to name it. When you call a method, you don't need to give value to this argument, since Python automatically will provide it. Let's see an example below. \n",
    "\n",
    "**EXAMPLE:** Define a class named *Student*, with the attributes *sid* (student id), *name*, *gender*, *type* in the *init* method and a method called *say_name* to print out the student's name. All the attributes will be passed in except *type*, which will have a value as 'learning'. "
