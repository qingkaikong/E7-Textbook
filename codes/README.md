Please note the followings when you contribute:

* Each person will work only on one chapter at a time, therefore, we should avoid conflict
* Everything will be using Jupyter notebook (Python 3), let me know if you have trouble. 
* **Naming convention for you notebook** - chapterX_name.ipynb
* Let's try to limit the packages you will use to numpy, scipy, matplotlib, os, glob, pickle, etc. If you want to use other packages, please discuss with me. 
* Let's try to keep the style consistent by following [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), or you can find a concise version [Here](https://pep8.org/) for the most important ones. 
* New examples or codes are welcome, but do talk to me before you work on that.
* Please don't work on the notebooks in the notebook folder, do talk to me if you want to change things there. 

Also, unrelated to coding, remember:

* Communication is important, if you need any help, do check with me or other members
* You are welcome to work together if you think that will be more efficient
* Our group meeting will be every Wed at 3 pm at my office McCone Hall 209.
