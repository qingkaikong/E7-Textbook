    "Many tasks in life are boring or tedious because they require doing the same  basic actions over and over again—iterating—in slightly different contexts. For example, consider looking up the definition of 20 words in the dictionary, populating a large table of numbers with data, alphabetizing many stacks of paper, or dusting off every object and shelf in your room. Since repetitive tasks appear so frequently, it is only natural that programming languages like Python would have direct methods of performing iteration.\n",
