    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing functions, it is very common to want certain parts of the function body to be executed only under certain conditions. For example, if the input argument is odd, you may want the function to perform one operation on it, and another if the input argument is even. This effect can be achieved in Python using branching statements (i.e., the execution of the function branches under certain conditions), which are the topic of this chapter.\n",
    "By the end of this chapter, you should be able to program branching statements into your functions and scripts, which should substantially increase the scope of tasks for which you will be able to make functions."

These conditions are represented as logical expres- sions. Let P, Q, and R be some logical expressions in Python. The following shows an if-statement construction.\n"

    "In the previous code, Python will first check if P is true. If P is true, then code block 1 will be executed, and then the if-statement will end. In other words, Python will not check the rest of the statements once it reaches a true statement. However, if P is false, then Python will check if Q is true. If Q is true, then code block 2 will be executed, and the if-statement will end. If it is false, then R will be executed, and so forth. If P, Q, and R are all false, then code block 4 will be executed. You can have any number of elif statements (or none) as long as there is at least one if-statement (the first statement). You do not need an else statement, but you can have at most one else statement. The logical expressions after the if and elif (i.e., such as P, Q, and R) will be referred to as conditional statements."
