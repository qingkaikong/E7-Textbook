    "An animation is a sequence of still frames, or plots, that are displayed in fast enough succession to create the illusion of continuous motion. Animations and movies often convey information better than individual plots. You can create animations in Python by calling a plot function inside of a loop (usually a for-loop). The main tools for making animations in Python is the *matplotlib.animation.Animation* base class, which provides a framework around which the animation functionality is built. Let's see an example.\n",

It serves as a place holder for the things that will change later in the movie, this is equivalent to tell Python that we will have a red point that later I will update the location of the point.

Then we are entering into the core part of the movie making - to update the figure. We use a for-loop to update the figure, and in each loop, we change the location (x, y location) of the red circle.
