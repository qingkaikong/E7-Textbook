    "A **class** is a definition of the structure that we want. Similar to a function, it is defined as a block of code, starting with the class statement. The syntax of defining a class is:\n",

    "class ClassName(superclass):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __init__(self, arguments):\n",
    "        # define or assign object attributes\n",

    "        # body of the method\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the definition of a class is very similar to a function. It needs to be instantiated first before you can use it. For the class name, it is standard convention to use \"CapWords.\" The **superclass** is used when you want create a new class to **inherit** the attributes and methods from another already defined class. We will talk more about **inheritance** in the next section. The **\\_\\_init\\_\\_** is one of the special methods in Python classes that is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated (created). It assigns initial values to the object before it is ready to be used. Note the two underscores at the beginning and end of the\n",
    "`init`, indicating this is a special method reserved for special use in the language.\n",
    "In this `init` method, you can assign attributes directly when you create the object. The `other_methods`\n",
    "functions are used to define the instance methods that will be applied on the attributes, just like functions we discussed before. You may notice that there is a parameter `self` for defining this method in the class. Why? A class instance method must have this extra argument as the first argument when you define it. This particular argument refers to the object itself; conventionally, we use `self` to name it. Through this self parameter, instance methods can freely access attributes and other methods in the same object. When we define or call an instance method within a class, we need to use this self parameter. Let us see an example below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**EXAMPLE:** Define a class named `Student`, with the attributes `sid` (student id), `name`, `gender`, `type` in the `init` method and a method called `say_name` to print out the student's name. All the attributes will be passed in except `type`, which will have a value as 'learning'. "
