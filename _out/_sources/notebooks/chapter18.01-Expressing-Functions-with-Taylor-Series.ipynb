    "A **sequence** is an ordered set of numbers denoted by the list of numbers inside parentheses. For example, $s = (s_1, s_2, s_3, \\cdots)$ means $s$ is the sequence $s_1, s_2, s_3, \\cdots$ and so on. In this context, \"ordered\" means that $s_1$ comes *before* $s_2$, not that $s_1 < s_2$. Many sequences have a more complicated structure. For example, $s = (n^2, n\\in N)$ is the sequence 0, 1, 4, 9, $\\cdots$. A **series** is the sum of a sequence up to a certain element. An **infinite sequence** is a sequence with an infinite number of terms, and an **infinite series** is the sum of an infinite sequence.\n",
