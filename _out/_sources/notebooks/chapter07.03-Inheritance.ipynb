    "We have already seen the modeling power of the OOP using the class and object by combining data and methods. But there is one more important concept, **inheritance**, which make the OOP code more modular and easier to reuse. Inheritance can let a new class to process the data and methods from a defined class, and then we can add modifications on the class. Usually the new class is called a child class and the one that inherit from is called parent class or superclass. Back to the definition of the class structure, we can see a basic inheritance is **class ClassName(superclass)**, which means the new class get all the attributes and methods from the superclass. Let's try an example. \n",

In addition, it should have one *clear_data* method to delete the data. "
