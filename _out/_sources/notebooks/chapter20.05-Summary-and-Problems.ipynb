    "3. Finite differences approximate the derivative by ratios of differences in the function value over small intervals.\n",

    "1. Write a function $my\\_der\\_calc(f, a, b, N, option)$, with the output as $[df, X]$, where $f$ is a function object, $a$ and $b$ are scalars such that a < b, $N$ is an integer bigger than 10, and $option$ is the string $forward$, $backward$, or $central$. Let $x$ be an array starting at $a$, ending at $b$, containing $N$ evenly spaced elements, and let $y$ be the array $f(x)$. The output argument, $df$, should be the numerical derivatives computed for $x$ and $y$ according to the method defined by the input argument, $option$. The output argument $X$ should be an array the same size as $df$ containing the points in $x$ for which $df$ is valid. Specifically, the forward difference method \"loses\" the last point, the backward difference method loses the first point, and the central difference method loses the first and last points.\n",

    "2. Write a function $my\\_num\\_diff(f, a, b, n, option)$, with the output as $[df, X]$, where $f$ is a function object. The function $my\\_num\\_diff$ should compute the derivative of $f$ numerical for $n$ evenly spaced points starting at $a$ and ending at $b$ according to the method defined by $option$. The input argument $option$ is one of the following strings: 'forward', 'backward', 'central'. Note that for the forward and backward method, the output argument, $dy$, should be $(n-1)$ 1D array, and for the central difference method $dy$ should be $(n-2)$ 1D array. The function should also output a vector $X$ that is the same size as $dy$ and denotes the x-values for which $dy$ is valid.\n",
