    "In engineering and science, **error** is a deviation from an expected or computed value. **Tolerance** is the level of error that is acceptable for an engineering application. We say that a computer program has **converged** to a solution when it has found a solution with an error smaller than the tolerance. When computing roots numerically, or conducting any other kind of numerical analysis, it is important to establish both a metric for error and a tolerance that is suitable for a given engineering/science application.\n",
    "\n",
    "For computing roots, we want an $x_r$ such that $f(x_r)$ is very close to 0. Therefore $|f(x)|$ is a possible choice for the measure of error since the smaller it is, the likelier we are to a root. Also if we assume that $x_i$ is the $i$th guess of an algorithm for finding a root, then $|x_{i+1} - x_i|$ is another possible choice for measuring error, since we expect the improvements between subsequent guesses to diminish as it approaches a solution. As will be demonstrated in the following examples, these different choices have their advantages and disadvantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TRY IT!** Let error be measured by $e = |f(x)|$ and tol be the acceptable level of error. The function $f(x) = x^2 + \\text{tol}/2$ has no real roots. However, $|f(0)| = {\\text{tol}}/2$ and is therefore acceptable as a solution for a root finding program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TRY IT!** Let error be measured by $e = |x_{i+1} - x_i|$ and tol be the acceptable level of error. The function $f(x) = 1/x$ has no real roots, but the guesses $x_i = -{\\text{tol}}/4$ and $x_{i+1} = {\\text{tol}}/4$ have an error of $e = {\\text{tol}}/2$ and is an acceptable solution for a computer program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these observations, the use of tolerance and converging criteria must be done very carefully and in the context of the program that uses them."
