    "Many numerical methods for solving initial value problems are designed specifically to solve first-order differential equations. To make these solvers useful for solving higher order differential equations, we must often **reduce the order** of the differential equation to first order. To reduce the order of a differential equation, consider a vector, $S(t)$, which is the **state** of the system as a function of time. In general, the state of a system is a collection of all the dependent variables that are relevant to the behavior of the system.

In particular, $\\frac{dS(t)}{dt} = {\\mathcal{F}}(t,S(t))$, where ${\\mathcal{F}}$ is a function that appropriately assembles the vector describing the derivative of the state. This equation is in the form of a first-order differential equation in $S$.
