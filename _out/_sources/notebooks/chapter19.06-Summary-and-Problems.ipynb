    "1. Roots are an important property of functions.\n",
    "2. The bisection method is a way of finding roots based on divide and conquer. Although stable, it might converge slowly compared to the Newton-Raphson method.\n",
    "3. The Newton-Raphson method is a different way of finding roots based on approximation of the function. The Newton-Raphson method converges quickly close to the actual root, but can have unstable behavior."

    "\n",
    "1. Write a function $my\\_nth\\_root(x, n, tol)$, where $x$ and $tol$ are strictly positive scalars, and $n$ is an integer strictly greater than 1. The output argument, $r$, should be an approximation $r = \\sqrt[N]{x}$, the $N$-th root of $x$. This approximation should be computed by using the Newton Raphson method to find the root of the function $f(y) = y^N - x$. The error metric should be $|f(y)|$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write a function $my\\_fixed\\_point(f, g, tol, max_iter)$, where $f$ and $g$ are function objects and $tol$ and $max\\_iter$ are strictly positive scalars. The input argument, $max\\_iter$, is also an integer. The output argument, $X$, should be a scalar satisfying $|f(X) - g(X)| < tol$; that is, $X$ is a point that (almost) satisfies $f(X) = g(X)$. To find $X$, you should use the Bisection method with error metric, $|F(m)| < tol$. The function $my\\_fixed\\_point$ should \"give up\" after $max\\_iter$ number of iterations and return $X = []$ if this occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Why does the bisection method fail for $f(x) = 1/x$ with error given by $|b-a|$? Hint: How does $f(x)$ violate the intermediate value theorem?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Write a function $my\\_bisection(f, a, b, tol)$, that returns $[R, E]$, where $f$ is a function object, $a$ and $b$ are scalars such that $a < b$, and $tol$ is a strictly positive scalar value. The function should return an array, $R$, where $R[i]$ is the estimation of the root of $f$ defined by $(a + b)/2$ for the $i$-th iteration of the bisection method. Remember to include the initial estimate. The function should also return an array, $E$, where $E[i]$ is the value of $| f(R[i]) |$ for the $i$-th iteration of the bisection method. The function should terminate when $E(i) < tol$. You may assume that ${\\text{sign}}(f(a)) \\neq {\\text{sign}}(f(b))$.\n",
    "\n",
    " Clarification: The input $a$ and $b$ constitute the first iteration of bisection, and therefore $R$ and $E$ should never be empty.\n",

    "5. Write a function $my\\_newton(f, df, x0, tol)$, that returns $[R, E]$, where $f$ is a function object, $df$ is a function object to the derivative of $f$, $x0$ is an initial estimation of the root, and $tol$ is a strictly positive scalar. The function should return an array, $R$, where $R[i)]$ is the Newton-Raphson estimation of the root of $f$ for the $i$-th iteration. Remember to include the initial estimate. The function should also return an array, $E$, where $E[i]$ is the value of $| f(R[i]) |$ for the $i$-th iteration of the Newton-Raphson method. The function should terminate when $E(i) < tol$.
