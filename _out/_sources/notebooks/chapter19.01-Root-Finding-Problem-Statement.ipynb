    "The **root** or **zero** of a function, $f(x)$, is an $x_r$ such that $f(x_r) = 0$. For functions such as $f(x) = x^2 - 9$, the roots are clearly 3 and $-3$. However, for other functions such as $f(x) = {\\rm cos}(x) - x$, determining an **analytic**, or exact, solution for the roots of functions can be difficult. For these cases, it is useful to generate numerical approximations of the roots of $f$ and understand the limitations in doing so. \n",
