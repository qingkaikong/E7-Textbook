    "The **Trapezoid Rule** fits a trapezoid into each subinterval and sums the areas of the trapezoid to approximate the total integral. This approximation for the integral to an arbitrary function is shown in the following figure. For each subinterval, the Trapezoid Rule computes the area of a trapezoid with corners at $(x_i, 0), (x_{i+1}, 0), (x_i, f(x_i))$, and $(x_{i+1}, f(x_{i+1}))$, which is $h\\frac{f(x_i) + f(x_{i+1})}{2}$. Thus, the Trapezoid Rule approximates integrals according to the expression\n",
