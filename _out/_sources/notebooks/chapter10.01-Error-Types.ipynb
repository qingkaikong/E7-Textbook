    "We have noted errors before but have not yet talked about them in detail. There are three basic types of errors that programmers need to be concerned about: **Syntax errors**, **runtime errors**, and **Logical errors**. **Syntax**is the set of rules that govern a language. In written and spoken language, rules can be bent or even broken to accommodate the speaker or writer. However, in a programming language the rules are rigid. A syntax error occurs when the programmer writes an instruction using incorrect syntax and Python can not understand what you are saying. For example, `1 = x` is not legal in the Python programming language because numbers cannot be assigned as variables. If the programmer tries to execute one of these instructions or any other syntactically incorrect statement, Python will return an error to the programmer and point out the line where the error occurred. Note: the complained location is where the syntax error is detected by the parser, sometimes, the place causing the error may be far away from the pointed out line. \n",

Therefore, the line out = 0 is a logic error. It does not produce a runtime error by Python, but it leads to an incorrect computation of factorial.\n",

    "Although the logic errors seem unlikely to occur--or at least as easy to find as other kinds of errors--when programs become longer and more complicated, these types of errors are very easy to generate and notoriously difficult to find. When logic errors occur, you have no choice but to meticulously comb through each line of your code until you find the problem. For these cases, it is important to know exactly how Python will respond to every command you give and not make any assumptions. You can also use Python's debugger, which will be described in the last section of this chapter."
