Until the value is changed or the variable deleted, the character x behaves like the value 1."

    "Note that the equal sign in programming is *not* the same as a truth statement in mathematics. In math, the statement *x = 2* declares the universal truth within the given framework, *x is 2*. In programming, the statement `x=2` means a known value is being associated with a variable name, *store* 2 in x. Although it is perfectly valid to say *1 = x* in mathematics, assignments in Python always go *left*: meaning the value to the right of the equal sign is assigned to the variable on the left of the equal sign. Therefore, *1=x* will generate an error in Python. The assignment operator is always last in the order of operations relative to mathematical, logical, and comparison operators."
