    "9. Fins are used in many applications to increase the heat transfer from surfaces. Usually the design of cooling pin fins is encountered in many applications, such as the pin fin used as a heat sink for cooling an object. We can model the temperature distribution in a pin fin as shown in the following figure, where the length of the fin is $L$, and the start and the end of the fin is $x=0$ as well as $x=L$. The temperature at the two ends are $T_0$ and $T_L$. $T_s$ is the temperature of the surrounding environment. If we consider both convection and radiation, the steady-state temperature distribution of the pin fin $T(x)$ between $x=0$ and $x=L$ can be modeled with the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    " $$\\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} - \\alpha_1(T - T_s) - \\alpha_2(T^4 - T^4) = 0$$\n",

And they are defined as $\\alpha_1 = \\frac{h_cP}{kA_c}$ and $\\alpha_2 = \\frac{\\epsilon\\sigma_{SB}P}{kA_c}$, where $h_c$ is the convective heat transfer coefficient, $P$ is the perimeter bounding the cross section of the fin, $\\epsilon$ is the radiative emissivity of the surface of the fin, $k$ is the thermal conductivity of the fin material, $A_c$ is the cross-sectional area of the fin, and $\\sigma_{SB} = 5.67 \\times 10^{-8} W/(m^2K^2)$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. \n",
    "\n",
    " Determine the temperature distribution if $L=0.2$ m, $T(0)=475K$, $T(0.1) = 290 K$, and $T_s = 290 K$. Use the following values for the parameters $h_c = 40 W/m^2/K$, $P=0.015$ m, $\\epsilon = 0.4$, $k=240 W/m/K$, and $A_c=1.55 \\times 10^{-5} m^2$\n",
