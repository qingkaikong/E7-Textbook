    "A **differential equation** is a relationship between a function, $f(x)$, its independent variable, $x$, and any number of its derivatives.

For an ODE of order $n$, a **particular solution** is a $p(x)$ that satisfies the differential equation *and n* explicitly **known values** of the solution, or its derivatives, at certain points. Generally stated, $p(x)$ must satisfy the differential equation and $p^{(j)}(x_i) = p_i$, where $p^{(j)}$ is the $j^{\\mathrm{th}}$ derivative of $p$, for $n$ triplets, $(j, x_i, p_i)$.

    "A pendulum swinging at small angles is a very uninteresting pendulum indeed. Unfortunately, there is no explicit solution for the pendulum equation with large angles that is as simple algebraically.

    "A common set of known values for an ODE solution is the **initial value**. For an ODE of order $n$, the initial value is a known value for the $0^{\\mathrm{th}}$ to $(n-1)^{\\mathrm{th}}$ derivatives at $x = 0, f(0), f^{(1)}(0), f^{(2)}(0),\\ldots, f^{(n-1)}(0)$. For a certain class of ordinary differential equations, the initial value is sufficient to find a unique particular solution. Finding a solution to an ODE given an initial value is called the **initial value problem**. Although the name suggests we will only cover ODEs that evolve in time, initial value problems can also include systems that evolve in other dimensions such as space. Intuitively, the pendulum equation can be solved as an initial value problem because under only the force of gravity, an initial position and velocity should be sufficient to describe the motion of the pendulum for all time afterward.\n",

    "The remainder of this chapter covers several methods of numerically approximating the solution to initial value problems on a numerical grid. Although initial value problems encompass more than just differential equations in time, we use time as the independent variable. We also use several notations for the derivative of $f(t): f^{\\prime}(t), f^{(1)}(t), \\frac{df(t)}{dt}$, and $\\dot{f}$, whichever is most convenient for the context.\n"
